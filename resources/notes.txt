TODO

- field check of records during name analysis (?)
- syntax: record ; end is allowed (not by me now).
- Int overflow stuff.
- No arrays in non-var formal params
- Nominal typing.
- out of bounds checks?
- arrays cannot be assigned (and records?)
- Case labels should be constants
- Apparently, this is not allowed: bvar := bvar =/# TRUE 
- Div by zero check in constants (in check?)

Problems
- cannot assign to formal params/vars of outer proc in nested proc
(~/CWI/ldta-2011/tests/jastadd/negative/name_errors/L3/10_VariableAccess2.ob)
- |project://oberon0/tests/silver/positive/L3/gcd_recursive.ob|
  (local var n is not found???)

Syntax

- Can vars/const/types shadow builtin procs in L4?

- Can procedures see procs at the same level later (Factorize, Corec)?

- Is this:
    PROCEDURE f(a : INTEGER);
		CONST C = 2 * (a + 3);
	END f;
  a name or type error?:: NAME

- Is this PROCEDURE g(ar : ARRAY 10 OF INTEGER); allowed
   --> not allowed, only in VAR position...

- !!! ~/CWI/ldta-2011/tests/jastadd/negative/type_errors/L4/17_CombiningArraysAndRecords2.ob
   (this does out of bounds checking statically, but this cannot be possible)

 
- ~/CWI/ldta-2011/tests/jastadd/negative/type_errors/L4/6_IllegalAssignment3.ob
  No assignments to complex types???
  
- Should the parser reject integers bigger than 2^32?
